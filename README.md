# Central workflows repository

This project contains all the callable workflows for Ultimate - made public because of github limitations. With time it would be an interesting opensource project. 

## Quick start

For calling any of this workflows, just choose the situation in which you want them to be called and shoot. Example of caller workflow:

```
name: "Open PR to main branch"

on:
 pull_request:
   branches:
     - main

jobs:
  test_build:
    uses: ultimateai/workflows/.github/workflows/ts_open-pr.yml@0.1.2
    with:
      test_command: "npm run test"
    secrets: inherit
```

Mind two things:
1. the _situation_ in which you want your workflow to be called - on pull request, on push, on dispatch... Name of each workflow suggests the situation in which they were think of to be called, so if you decide to invoke them on any other situation, be assured it *won't* have been tested at all =). 
2. The parameters each workflow needs - this is updated fairly frequently, so best way to be sure it's to check each workflow's required inputs!

## Workflows and inputs

-   `deploy-from-branch.yml`: This action is thought to be called manually (as any other deployment), and it allows to deploy the code from any branch of your repository into development (and just development!)
Inputs:
    - test_command: (Optional ðŸŸ£) Customizable, by default is npm run test, but can be disabled if set to empy string
    - build_command: (Optional ðŸŸ£) Customizable, by default is npm run build, but can be disabled if set to empy string
    - lint_command: (Optional ðŸŸ£) Customizable, by default is npm run lint, but can be disabled if set to empy string
    - npm_install_command: (Optional ðŸŸ£) Customizable, by default is npm i, but can be disabled if set to empy string

    - node_version: (Optional ðŸŸ£) Default is 16.x
    - image_repo: container registry (like eu.gcr.io/ultimateai-169214)
    - app_squad: folder inside k8s-repo containing your kustomize code (backend, qa, ia...)
    - branch_name: branch whose code you want to build and deploy
    - github_email: automatic bot email for commiting 
    - github_user: automatic bot user for commiting 
    - k8s_manifests_repo: {organization}/{repo} containing your argoCD-linked repo like ultimateai/k8s-manifests
-   `open-pr.yml`: This actions will happen whenever you open a PR agains main, and it will do some basic checks - npm i, npm test, docker build.
Input:
    - test_command: (Optional ðŸŸ£) Customizable, by default is npm run test, but can be disabled if set to empy string
    - build_command: (Optional ðŸŸ£) Customizable, by default is npm run build, but can be disabled if set to empy string

    - node_version: (Optional ðŸŸ£) Default is 16.x
-   `merged-pr.yml`: TThis action will happen whenever you successfully merge a PR into main, and will bump the release on your repo, build and push the image with the updated tag and, finally, automatically deploy to development or staging environment (as long as your app exists in k8s-manifest repo!). Note on bumping version: Bumping will be major (1.0.0-->2.0.0), minor(1.0.0-->1.1.0) or patch(1.0.0-->1.0.1) depending on the wording of your _LAST_ squased commit. Default behaviour is patch.

## Important limitations
1. If you try to deploy a version in production which is NOT deployed in staging, workflow will fail ðŸ”´
2. If you try to deploy a version which is already deployed, workflow will kindly warn you, but it won't fail on version 0.15.0+


## TODO
1. Python support
2. Lint and verify k8s repo - https://github.com/devxp-tech/gitops/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml
