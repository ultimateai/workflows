# Central workflows repository

This project contains all the callable workflows for Ultimate - made public because of github limitations. With time it would be an interesting opensource project. 

## Quick start

For calling any of this workflows, just choose the situation in which you want them to be called and shoot. Example of caller workflow:

```
name: "Open PR to main branch"

on:
 pull_request:
   branches:
     - main

jobs:
  test_build:
    uses: ultimateai/workflows/.github/workflows/ts_open-pr.yml@0.1.2
    with:
      test_command: "npm run test"
    secrets: inherit
```

## Workflows and inputs

-   `open-pr.yml`: This actions will happen whenever you open a PR agains main, and it will do some basic checks - npm i, npm test, docker build.
Input:
    - test_command: (Optional ðŸŸ£) Customizable, by default is npm run test, but can be disabled if set to empy string
-   `merged-pr.yml`: TThis action will happen whenever you successfully merge a PR into main, and will bump the release on your repo, build and push the image with the updated tag and, finally, automatically deploy to development environment (as long as your app exists in k8s-manifest repo!). Note on bumping version: Bumping will be major (1.0.0-->2.0.0), minor(1.0.0-->1.1.0) or patch(1.0.0-->1.0.1) depending on the wording of your _LAST_ commit. Default behaviour is patch.

    - github_user: automatic bot user for commiting

## Important limitations
1. Only chaper leads can deploy a version different from the latest one ðŸ”´
2. If you try to deploy a version in production which is NOT deployed in staging, workflow will fail ðŸ”´


## TODO
1. Python support
2. Lint and verify k8s repo - https://github.com/devxp-tech/gitops/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml
